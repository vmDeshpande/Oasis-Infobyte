#  Advanced Calculator

  

An advanced calculator built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript. This calculator includes basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced mathematical functions like square root, sine, cosine, and tangent. It also supports parentheses for more complex expressions.

  

##  Features

  

-  **Basic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.

-  **Advanced Operations**: Square root (`âˆš`), Sine (`sin`), Cosine (`cos`), Tangent (`tan`).

-  **Parentheses Support**: Allows functions to be applied to numbers inside parentheses.

-  **Clear and Delete**: Options to clear the display or delete the last character.

-  **Responsive Design**: Works well across various devices with Tailwind CSS for styling.

  

##  Demo

  

You can see a live demo of the calculator by opening the `index.html` file in your browser.

  

##  Files Overview

  

-  `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the calculator.

-  `script.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for calculator functionality.

-  `styles.css`: Custom styles for the calculator (optional, can be enhanced with Tailwind CSS).

  

##  Installation

  

1. Clone this repository:

```
Download this Folder.
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to start using the calculator.

## How It Works
### `index.html`

The main structure of the calculator is laid out in this file, including buttons for numbers, operations, and functions. The layout is responsive and designed using **Tailwind CSS**.
### `script.js`

This script contains the logic for:

-   **Appending values to the display** when buttons are clicked.
-   **Clearing or deleting values** from the display.
-   **Evaluating the expression** using JavaScript's `eval()` function and handling errors gracefully.

## Usage

1.  Click the buttons for numbers or operations to form a mathematical expression.
2.  Use the `C` button to clear the entire display.
3.  Use the `DEL` button to delete the last character entered.
4.  Press `=` to evaluate the expression.
5.  The calculator supports advanced math functions like square root, sine, cosine, and tangent, which you can use for scientific calculations.
